<h2>✨ About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in data, technology, and business problem-solving.
While I specialize in Data Analytics, my experience extends beyond technical work. I have supported academic
programs as a Teaching Assistant, worked in customer-facing roles at Target, and led initiatives through
campus organizations and community engagement projects.

I am comfortable working in professional office environments, managing multiple responsibilities,
communicating with diverse groups, and handling confidential information with care.
I bring strong organizational skills, attention to detail, Microsoft Office proficiency,
and the ability to adapt quickly in fast-paced team settings.

Whether supporting program operations, assisting participants, organizing communications, or contributing to team initiatives,
I aim to create positive, structured, and impactful experiences in every environment I serve.
